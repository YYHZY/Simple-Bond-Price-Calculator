# Simple-Bond-Price-Calculator
A na√Øve attempt on using python to price the simple bonds. Added functions to calculate the withholding tax on amortisation as well, which is applied in some SEA markets.
It comes with ISDA daycount function.
It is just a beta version by a python newbie and could run into errors. 
On going maintenance and enhancement.
